# babel-plugin-add-jsdoc-properties

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/motiz88/babel-plugin-add-jsdoc-properties.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Adds [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) annotations to source code.

This module only handles a handful of cases at the moment, designed to take the tedium out of documenting ES2015+ classes with JSDoc.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/motiz88/babel-plugin-add-jsdoc-properties.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/motiz88/babel-plugin-add-jsdoc-properties)

*Deprecation notice:* Now that [documentation.js](http://documentation.js.org/) is a thing, this plugin will be retired. documentation.js is based on Babel, is actively developed, supports JSDoc syntax and is already very smart about inferring what it can from ES2015+ code. If anyone does want to pick up maintenance and npm releases going forward, I might be open to the idea, but I really think all the effort should rather directed at the documentation.js project.
